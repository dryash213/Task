C.How you can leverage machine learning to predict prices for a given
market in Agra for the crop “Potato”.

Ans:- We can use machine Learning to find the pattern when the price goes higher and which crop gets lower profit/price. The data will be used in a time series forecast to find the next 10Days(Let suppose) of Price. 
Article:- there is a huge rise expected so we can invest our time to get better output.
